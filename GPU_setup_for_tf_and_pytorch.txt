This tutorial is guide you how to install tensorflow and pytorch in different environment the same cuda.

The installation precedure is follow below:

**Setup for Pytorch
-First, we have to check our NVIDIA driver that we installed for our systems by follow the command: nvidia-smi.

The status should be showed as with version that our pc is using cuda(Ex. cuda 12.1, in my case).

after that, here I used with miniconda environment and the procedure setup as follows:

-First created environment by using this command: conda create -n environment_name python=version. Then we can activate this environment in order to access and process the installation. To activate this environment is use conda activate environment_name. 

Also, if you want to delete or remove the environment that we created just type this command: conda env remove --name environment_name.

-Second, to install pytorch based your current version cuda support which from the details you check of nvidia-smi, you can use this command to install the pytorch based GPU by following this command: conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia. Which you can check from this website (https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). Now you successfully install pytorch based on your cuda supported version.

**Setup for tensorflow

This part is continue from the above, but we focus on adding tensorflow to the different conda environment.

In order to be more convenient or no conflict, you should create new environment that is for your tensorflow setup only.

You can follow the above to create the environment of your tensorflow. Then, you have to activate to your tensorflow environment and do with pip (not conda), pip install tensorflow=2.9 (support for the latest of cuda version 11.2).
